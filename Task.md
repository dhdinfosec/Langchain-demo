# Langchain-demo
**Sr TSE - LS Prompt**

**Background**

We want to see how you think like a builder and support engineer - how you learn tools, experiment with features, and communicate technical feedback. This task is designed to assess your ability to understand and work with LangSmith and LangGraph.

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-step applications powered by LLMs. It enables the creation of agents and workflows that can manage memory, looping, conditional branching, and other logic needed for more sophisticated applications. LangSmith experiments allow users to test and evaluate those applications including LangGraph-powered agents - using datasets and scoring functions like LLM-as-a-judge.

We're not looking for perfection or polish we're looking for signal in your thinking:
* How do you reason about LangGraph's design model (nodes, edges, states)?
* How do you connect LangGraph applications with LangSmith evaluation tools?
* Can you identify what's working, what's confusing, and how it could improve?

**What You'll Be Doing**

Your task is to build a simple agent of your choice using LangGraph and then run an evaluation experiment in LangSmith, using both the SDK and the UI.

LangGraph provides low-level infrastructure for long-running, stateful workflows and agents. LangSmith lets you evaluate these workflows using test datasets, custom metrics, and LLM-based scoring to measure attributes like correctness, helpfulness, or hallucination. This simulates a realistic developer scenario: testing and refining a LangGraph application with LangSmith's tools.

**Task**

1.  Design and build a simple LangGraph-based agent or workflow (e.g., retrieval-augmented agent, multi-step QA, or tool-using planner).
2.  Create or select a small dataset (can be synthetic) to test your app.
3.  Run a LangSmith evaluation experiment using both:
    * The LangSmith UI, and
    * The LangSmith SDK (programmatically)
4.  Focus on realism debug or improve your agent like a real user would.

**Resources**

* LangGraph Docs
* LangSmith Evaluation Docs
* LangSmith Academy

**What to Share**

* A short walkthrough (~15 min) on our next call covering:
    * What you built using LangGraph
    * How you evaluated it with LangSmith
    * What you learned or found surprising
    * What might confuse a new user
* A link to your code snippets or repo
* Optionally, a "friction log" - anything unclear, buggy, or unintuitive you'd flag to the team if you were already on the job
